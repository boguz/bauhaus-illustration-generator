An interactive bauhaus illustration generator experiment, which creates a random illustration in the Bauhaus styles using canvas with vanilla JS.

Currently only available on desktop.

### Features
- Draw a random illustration with default settings when page loads
- Draw new illustration on illustration click
- Define number of cells via range input
- Define illustration colors
- Button to reset settings to default

### Ideas
- [ ] Change JS into TypeScript
- [ ] Add mobile styles
- [ ] Add "animate" button, which would create new animation every x seconds
- [ ] Add "export" button, which would export illustration as svg or pdf
